Author’s note- This is a working list of rules, mechanics, and other relevant information for the work in progress project RPS [working title]. These rules and mechanics are likely to change as the project progresses. This page has been written and edited by Luke Williams, acting director of this projects. This page is exclusive to Luke Williams and David McCarthy, acting manager of project infrastructure.
Game Rules
Game played over 9 rounds.
You gain a point for winning the round unless stated otherwise. 
Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins. 

There is a pool of modifier cards that players will create their deck from. This deck cannot be changed once the game begins, but it can be changed between games. This deck will consist of 10 (?) cards. Cards can only appear once in a players deck at the beginning of the game, although there may be cards that allow you to duplicate the effects or create copies of these cards during a game. 

There are two options for how decks will be created.

Option 1) Before the game begins,you and your opponent choose from the full list of cards.

Option 2) When a game starts, an identical pool of 20 random cards from the main list are presented to both players. From this list, both players will select their cards. 

For testing reasons, I lean more towards option 1. 

At the beginning of the game you will have your RPS cards in your hand, along with two cards from your deck. Draw phase is skipped first round. 

At the beginning of each round, you and your opponent draw one card. You may play a card at any time, unless it is stated otherwise. Cards that are not played are carried over to the next round. 

The first turn is determined by a coin flip. Turn order alternates between rounds, unless otherwise stated. 

There should be some kind of prompt whenever an action is taken for the player to either play or skip (so it gives the players the option to 'interrupt by playing a deck card). Card art will be determined later, but I like the idea that when you hover over a card it gives a description of what it does in a text box close to the mouse or at the bottom of the screen.  

In the case of ties in which both players reveal the same RPS card, (ex. both players choose ROCK), then the round continues using the remaining cards in hand. (* I am thinking that maybe players should either draw a new card or be able to play all RPS cards, rather than only using the remaining two cards).
Phases of the game 

Draw phase
RPS Select Phase 
Reveal Phase/ End Step 

Action Cards can be played after the Draw phase, and after the RPS Phase. This has been marked with *Play a card prompt* in the list below.

Round begins
Draw phase- round begins. Both players draw from the top of their deck and add the cards to their hand.


*Play a card prompt*
RPS select phase- One of your RPS cards is selected and placed faced down on the table. The remaining two cards are placed to the side face down on the table. 
*Play a card prompt*
Reveal Phase/ End step- Played RTS cards are revealed and the round resolves. Points are scored. Go to next draw phase.



	
ALTERNATE GAME TYPES
Authors note- These are alternate ways that this game can theoretically play. They are not meant to be to replace the above rules, although elements from these game types may be incorporated in the future. Should be discussed later. It may be that these become modifiers that players can select before the game begins, or is randomly selected before players choose cards for their decks. 

Hydra Game- Instead of playing one card, players play all three of they’re RPS cards face down, and go head to head in three hands at once, scoring for every hand they win. 

Chance game- Ties are decided by coin flips. 

Recycled Game- At the end of the round, discarded cards are sent to your opponents deck and shuffled. 

Blitz Game- Your starting deck has 6 cards. Game lasts only 5 rounds. 

Game of Memory- Players have three copies of each RPS cards in a side bet. These cards can only be played once, and are then discarded. At the beginning of the game, Players draw three of these cards at random. At the beginning of each hand, players draw a new RPS card from their deck. 

Normal Game- Play as normal.

Multiplayer- 

Play with 4+ people? 6?

Matchmaking- assuming that this game has widespread appeal, would there be a matchmaking function?

Would need to have a way to set up private games and random matchmaking games. 
What would the ‘progression’ system be and look like? 

-Could we track the wins/ losses vs certain players? Could we track stats for the players? 

Possible Stats
	Number of wins/ losses
	Times played Rock 
	Times played Paper
	Times played Scissors
	Stats for what cards were selected for your deck
-This would actually be a good way to track what cards are being used and what cards are not being used. This would be a balancing tool. 

	Stats for how many times specific cards were played 
-This would actually be a good way to track what cards are being used and what cards are not being used. This would be a balancing tool. 
	Favorite Card (Combine the two above stats) 
	Least Favorite Card (Same as Favorite Card but in reverse
 	Highest scoring round
	Highest scoring game
	Nemesis- who have you played against the most
 	

Alternate art- 
	Would there be a way to do alternate art for the cards or the game board? Cosmetic card backs or holographic editions of cards? Would function the same but it would mean swapping art for both yourself and an opponent. Allows for more personalization of decks for players. Could also lead to some kind of reward or  progression system. Would prefer to work away from microtransactions or bot farming. To be workshopped
